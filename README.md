# scripts
A personal repository to store scripts created and used for everyday things.


# usage

To add the scripts to your path simply run the add_to_path script to export the scripts dir to your path and include it on you zshrc or bashrc file. 

```
add_to_path path/to/scripts/dir
```

Create new scripts by running the create_script command to create a new executable bash script for a given name. scripts created this way will be executable from your path, as they are locally added to the scripts repository.

```
create_script script_name
```
